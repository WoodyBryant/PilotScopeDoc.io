**PilotScope** is a middleware to bridge the gaps of deploying AI4DB (Artificial Intelligence for Databases) algorithms into actual database systems. It aims at hindering the underlying details of different databases so that an AI4DB driver could steer any database in a unified manner. By applying PilotScope, we obtain the following benefits:

* The DB users could experience any AI4DB algorithm as a plug-in unit on their databases with little cost. The cloud computing service providers could operate and maintain AI4DB algorithms on their database products as a service to users. **(More Convenient for Usage! 👏👏👏)**

* The ML researchers could easily benchmark and iterate their AI4DB algorithms in practical scenarios. **(Much Faster to Iterate! ⬆️⬆️⬆️)**

* The ML and DB developers are liberated from learning the details in other side. They could play their own strengths to write the codes in their own sides. **(More Freedom to Develop! 🏄‍♀️🏄‍♀️🏄‍♀️)**


* All contributors could extend PilotScope to support more AI4DB algorithms, more databases and more functions. **(We highly encourage this! 😊😊😊)**

# Overview

At first, we illustrate the general system architecture of PilotScope as follows:

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../_static/sysarch.png", width=620px, alt="PilotScope System Architecture" />
</div>


PilotScope provides a _**console**_ to operate the whole system. It manages multiple _**AI4DB drivers**_  and the _**DB interactor**_. The DB interactor contains an _**interface**_ connecting AI4DB drivers with databases. It contains multiple APIs, namely _**injection interface**_ to inject AI4DB algorithms to replace database tasks, 
 _**data collection**_ to collect training data and _**push/pull operators**_ to allow AI4DB algorithms to exchange data with the databases. Each database steered by the AI4DB drivers is attached with its specific _**implementations of DB interactor**_.


For the detailed working pineline of PilotScope and in-depth description of each component in PilotScope, please refer to the section **[System Pipeline](section-system-pipeline)** and section **[Core Component](section-core-components)**, respectively.


## How to Apply PilotScope?

To database users (👨‍💼 , 👩‍⚕️ or 👤), PilotScope is totally transparent. The database user can access PilotScope through its console, log into the native database, and then perform database operations using the same commands as usual. The user can start any AI4DB driver using a simple command. Then, PilotScope would automatically execute the AI4DB algorithm whenever necessary. For example, if the user starts the AI4DB driver of a learned query optimizer, the database would automatically apply this learned query optimizer to generate execution plan for each input SQL query. 

The general workflow on applying an AI4DB driver in PilotScope is illustrated as follows:

### Supported Tasks and Algorithms

Currently, PilotScope focuses on database tasks in the query optimization workflow shown as follows.

## How to Develop in PilotScope?

PilotScope could support to deploy any AI4DB method on top of any native database. 

To ML developers (👩‍💻 or 🧑🏻‍💻), as well as researchers (👨‍🔬 or 👩🏻‍🔬), they could focus on writing the ML programs using AI-friendly language, e.g., Python. The ML programms could directly invoke the APIs in the interface of DB interactor to inject the AI4DB method or enforce actions into databases, and exchange data with the databases. The interface of DB interactor keeps the same for any database. In such way, the ML developers are liberated from the underlying details of the database codes. Meanwhile, the same AI4DB dirver could be applied to steer multiple different database systems.

To DB developers (👨🏻‍💻 or 🥷), they are responsible to implement all APIs in the interface of DB interactor in each specific database. They are familiar with the codebase of the database so they could find the best way to implement these interaction APIs as lightweight patches. Implementing these patches is much easier than integrating a complete ML program into databases. What they do is just like their ordinary work on developing new features on the native database.

The general working paradigm on developing an AI4DB driver in PilotScope is illustrated as follows:


<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

### Developing Details

For the details on the interaction and other APIs in PilotScope, please refer to the sections **[API (ML Side)](section-api-ml-side)** and **[Database Side Develop](section-database-side-develop)**.


## What to Do in PilotScope?

PilotScope can be easily extended to support more AI4DB algorithms for more AI4DB tasks on more databases. According to its working paradigm, we warmly welcome the open-source community to contribute their efforts on PilotScope from these aspects:

* Write more AI4DB algorithms into ML programs;

* Propose more APIs in the interface of the DB interactor;

* Implement the interaction APIs on more databases;

* Develop more features to enrich the functionality in PilotScope.

**We sincerely invite all contributors (👦, 👩, 👱🏻‍♂️, 👩🏻‍🦳, 🧓, 👵🏻, 👩‍🏫, 👨‍🏫, or 👥) to build this open-source community around PilotScope together! 💪🏻 💪🏻 💪🏻**

**We could foster collaborations and accelerate the research iterations 👣 👣 👣 of AI4DB methods, and simultaneously make AI4DB more applicable and viable for production scenarios (🏭, 🖥 or📱).**
